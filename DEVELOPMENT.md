## 🚀 Current Implementation Status

### What's Working Now

1. **Core Application**: Electron app starts and loads React interface
2. **Infinite Canvas**:
   - Pan with mouse drag
   - Zoom with mouse wheel
   - Grid background that scales with zoom
   - Viewport position tracking
3. **Window Management**:
   - Create windows of different types via toolbar
   - Drag windows around the canvas
   - Resize windows with corner/edge handles
   - Window selection and z-index management
   - Lock/unlock functionality
   - Minimize/restore (UI only)
4. **AI Tool System**:
   - 15+ implemented tools for window management
   - IPC communication between main and renderer
   - Tool execution pipeline with error handling
5. **UI Components**:
   - Floating toolbar with window type selection
   - Window chrome with title bars and controls
   - Basic window content for different types
   - Status indicators and metrics display

## 🐛 Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Current Issues

1. **Canvas Performance**: Large numbers of windows may impact performance (needs virtualization)
2. **Window Content**: Most window types show placeholder content
3. **Persistence**: No state persistence between app restarts
4. **Error Handling**: Limited error boundaries and user feedback

### Technical Decisions Needed

1. **Canvas Library**: Custom implementation vs react-flow vs other?
2. **State Management**: Zustand vs Redux Toolkit vs Context?
3. **Vector Database**: ChromaDB vs Pinecone vs Weaviate for local setup?
4. **Python Execution**: Docker vs Pyodide vs subprocess sandboxing?

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### This Session Goals

1. ✅ Create development tracking document
2. 🔄 Initialize Electron + React + TypeScript project
3. 🔄 Set up basic project structure
4. 🔄 Configure build tools and development environment
5. ⏳ Create basic main process and renderer setup

### Questions for Implementation

1. **Canvas Approach**: Should we start with a custom canvas implementation or use react-flow as a base?
2. **Window Management**: Do you want native OS windows or custom windows within the Electron app?
3. **AI Integration**: Do you have preferred AI providers/APIs we should prioritize for initial setup?
4. **Local Development**: Any specific local AI servers you're already using (LM Studio, Ollama)?

## 💡 Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions Made

1. **Electron + React + TypeScript** - Chosen for rapid development and cross-platform potential
2. **Modular Window System** - Each window type as separate component with common base
3. **Tool-First Design** - AI tools as first-class citizens in architecture
4. **Project-Based Organization** - Context isolation between projects

### Key Design Patterns

- **Command Pattern** for AI tool execution
- **Observer Pattern** for window state management
- **Strategy Pattern** for different AI providers
- **Factory Pattern** for window creation
