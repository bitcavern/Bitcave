- Artifact data should be stored as files in the project folder so it can be recalled across sessions. Will likely need to update the javascript bitcave api methods to account for this.

- We need a tree like file explorer that shows the project folder (with internal files hidden, like artifacts and metadata and such. We can use .folder .filenames to hide these, I think.)

- When creating a project there is no way to make a new folder, it prompts you to select an existing one.
